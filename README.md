## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for diabetes using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing various medical attributes of patients and uses these attributes to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It contains medical records for female patients of Pima Indian heritage, aged 21 and older. The dataset includes the following attributes:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age**: Age (years)
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0 or 1)

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
